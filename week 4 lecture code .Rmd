## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dfStable <- read_tsv("UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
```

This is a cross-wave data file with stable characteristics of individuals. See the codebook at https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/dataset-documentation/search/datafile/xwavedat.

Exercises.

1. Select the variables for: sex (derived), date of birth (doby_dv), ethnic group (racel_dv). Also keep the cross-wave identifier (pidp) and the sample origin variable (memorig).

    ```{r}

    dfStable1 <- dfStable %>%
      select(pidp, memorig, sex_dv, doby_dv, racel_dv)
    ```

2. Filter the data to keep:
        a) men only.
        b) people born before 1950 and after 1975.
        c) men of Pakistani origin born in 1958 or 1982. 


    ```{r}

    dfStable1 %>% 
      filter(sex_dv == 1)
    
    dfStable1 %>% count(doby_dv)
    dfStable1 %>%
      filter(doby_dv > 0 & (doby_dv < 1950 | doby_dv > 1975))
    
      dfStable1 %>%
      filter(racel_dv == 10)
      
      dfStable1 %>%
        filter(sex_dv ==1 &racel_dv == 10 & doby_dv >0 & (doby_dv < 1950 | doby_dv > 1975))
   
    ```

3. Recode birth year into cohorts (a new variable): the G.I. Generation (born before 1924), Silent Generation (1925-42), Baby Boomers (1943-65), Generation X (1966-1980), Millenials (1981-99), Generation Z (2000-). (The years are approximate.)

    ```{r}
    
   dfStable1 <-  dfStable1 %>% 
      mutate(cohorts = case_when(
             between(doby_dv, 0, 1924) ~ "G.I Generation", 
             between(doby_dv, 1925, 1942) ~ "Silent Generation", 
             between(doby_dv, 1943, 1965) ~ "Baby Boomers", 
             between(doby_dv, 1966, 1980) ~ "Generation X", 
             between(doby_dv, 1981, 1999) ~ "Millenials", 
             doby_dv > 2000 ~ "Generation Z"
             )) 
    
   dfStable1 %>% count(cohorts)
           
                              
             
    ```

4. Recode ethnicity into the following groups: white British, Other White, Indian, Pakistani, other. (This classification doesn't make much sense, but we're doing this as an exercise).


    ```{r}
      dfStable1 <- dfStable1 %>%
      mutate(ethNEW = recode(racel_dv,
        '1' = "White British", 
        '2' = "Other British", 
        '3' = "other white", 
        '9' = "Indian", 
        '10' = "Pakistani", 
        '-9' = NA_character_,
        .default = "other"
      )) 
    
    dfStable1%>% count(ethNEW)
    ```


5. Count the number of people belonging to different ethnic groups (and produce percentages). 

    ```{r}
    dfStable1 %>%
      count(ethNEW) %>%
      mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100)
    ```

6. Summarise the proportion of white British by generation.

    ```{r}
    
    dfStable1 %>%
  filter(racel_dv != -9) %>%
  mutate(whiteBritish = ifelse(racel_dv == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(cohorts) %>%
  summarise(
propWhiteBritish = mean(whiteBritish, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  )
     
    ```
